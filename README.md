# Todo App with Convex and Material-UI

## Project Description
This is a simple Todo application built with React, Convex, and Material-UI. The app allows users to create, view, update, and delete todos. The backend, powered by Convex, provides database and real-time functionality, while Material-UI ensures a clean and responsive user interface.

## Technologies Used
- **Convex**: Backend-as-a-service providing database and real-time updates.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: Component library for creating responsive, stylish UIs.

## Requirements
- **Node.js**: v14 or higher
- **Convex CLI**: For managing and deploying Convex functions and schema

# Functional Requirements

## Todo Management:
- **Add Todo**: Users can add new tasks to the todo list.
- **List Todos**: Display all tasks with their current status (completed or not).
- **Toggle Completion**: Users can mark tasks as completed or not completed.
- **Delete Todo**: Users can remove tasks from the list.

## Backend Integration:
- **CRUD Operations**: Implemented with Convex functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting todos.
- **Database Schema**: Structured schema to manage todos with fields for task text and completion status.

## User Interface:
- **Material-UI Components**: Used for a clean, responsive design.
- **Real-time Updates**: Display real-time updates for todos without page refresh.

## User Experience:
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the task input is not empty before adding it to the list.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages for failed backend operations.

# Non-Functional Requirements

## Performance:
- **Responsive UI**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Ensures a smooth and seamless user experience.

## Scalability:
- **Backend Scalability**: Convex backend can handle multiple users and a high volume of todos.

## Usability:
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive UI that is easy to navigate.
- **Clear Feedback**: Visual feedback on actions like loading indicators for backend operations.

## Reliability:
- **Error Handling and Resilience**: Graceful handling of network issues and unexpected errors.
- **Data Integrity**: Reliable storage and retrieval of todos.

## Maintainability:
- **Code Organization**: Modular structure for easy maintenance.
- **Documentation**: Clear comments and this README file provide setup and usage guidance.

## Security:
- **Data Protection**: Basic security measures to protect data integrity.
- **Future Authentication**: Plans to add user authentication for user-specific todos.

# Usage

### Add a Todo
- Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button. The task will appear in the list below.

### Toggle Completion
- Check the box next to a todo item to mark it as completed. Uncheck to mark as incomplete.

### Delete a Todo
- Click the delete button (to be implemented in future versions) next to a todo item to remove it from the list.

# Future Enhancements
- **User Authentication**: For user-specific todos and personalized experiences.
- **Edit Todo**: Add functionality to edit existing tasks.
- **Improved UI/UX**: Enhance styling and add animations for a better user experience.
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Provide more specific feedback for different errors.
